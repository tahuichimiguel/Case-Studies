## Graphical Analysis Case Studies

#### US Police Shooting Study: Graphical Analysis & Predictor Interactions
  - Three .CSV files from 2 separate Kaggle Datasets are used for this analysis. The 2 datasets were compiled by separate news entities: Washington Post & The Guardian.
  - **Languages:** R
  - **Goal 1:** Identify any situational clusters that may correlate with fatal police shootings of US citizens.
  - **Goal 2:** Determine if the data provided by the Washington Post & The Guardian corroborate each other.
  - **Status:** Active
  - Note: An additional analysis was performed on the Guardian data to investigate conditions that are most commonly associated with gunshot fatalities. The analysis is also posted on the Kaggle Dataset 'The Counted: Killed by Police, 2015-2016'
