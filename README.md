##Machine Learning Case Studies
#### California Housing: Prediction of California Housing Average Value Using Gradient Boosted Regression Trees 
  - Original Case Presentation presented by Peter Prettenhofer
  - Uses California Housing Dataset in Scikit-learn
  - **Language:** Python
  - **Goal:** Replicate Analysis and Plots

#### Accelerometer Activity Study: Predict Activity Based on Accelerometer Readings
  - The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
  - **Languages:** Python & R
  - **Goal:** Predict the manner in which the subject did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. 

#### US Police Shooting Study: Graphical & Cluster Analysis of 
  - The dataset for this case study is the Kaggle dataset 'Fatal Police Shootings, 2015 to Present'
  - **Languages:** R
  - **Goal:** Identify any situational clusters that may correlate with fatal police shootings of US citizens.
  
#### Human Resources Analytics
  - Exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling of 'Human Resources Analytics' Kaggle dataset.
  - **Language:** R
